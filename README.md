Stunnel (Secure Tunnel) is an open-source software designed for establishing secure (SSL/TLS) connections between two servers or two clients. The primary uses of Stunnel include:

1. **Secure Server Connections (Server-side SSL/TLS)**: Stunnel allows servers to easily accept and manage secure SSL/TLS connections. This is highly useful for protecting sensitive information transmitted to the server, such as passwords or financial data.

2. **Secure Port Forwarding**: With Stunnel, a regular port can be converted into a secure port, enabling a secure connection between two systems. This is valuable when there's a need for secure communication to transfer data from one system to another.

3. **SSL/TLS Certificate Management**: Stunnel provides the capability to manage SSL/TLS certificates. It allows servers to obtain and manage SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure communications.

4. **VPN Implementation (Virtual Private Network)**: Stunnel can be used as part of creating a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using SSL/TLS protocols. This enables users to securely access a network remotely.

In essence, Stunnel is a useful tool for enhancing the security of communications between two servers or two clients, and it is used as a fundamental technology for establishing secure communications in various networks.
